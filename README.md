You can use any [node-cron](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node-cron) compatible crontab format to schedule messages. Registered message will be sent to the same channel where you created a job.

To persist the cron job in the hubot restart, you're recommended to use redis to persist Hubot brain.

Timezones are specified in [tzdata format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database#Examples).
